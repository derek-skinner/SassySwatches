#Usage
------------------------------

##1. Setting Up

If your familiar with Sass, this should be a piece of cake. Make sure the main `sassyswatches.scss` file is imported at the very bottom of your `_main.scss` file so it will overwrite any similar color variables you may have in your project from other frameworks, etc.

    @import "/path/to/sassyswatches.scss"
    
    
####1a. Optonal - Bower Install
If your current project uses Bower, you can install Sassy Swatches by using the following command:

    bower install sassy-swatches

##2. Using the Colors

Now here's the fun part. If you want to use a color all you need to do is type in it's variable name. Sassy Swatches was built using memorable, real-world variable names for its colors like $Denim, $LawnGreen, $LightSalmonPink, etc.

	body{
			background-color: $DarkChestnut;
		}

You can use the Sassy Swatches color library with all existing [Sass Color Functions](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html) and Mixins.

Example Functions/Mixins
------------------------------
####Darken & Lighten

These two adjust the Lightness of the colorâ€™s HSL values. Sass will parse the hex color variable to hsl, then make the adjustments. You call them on the color with a percentage value between 0 and 100.

    darken($Jade, 10%)
    lighten($WineDregs, 10%)

####Saturate, & Desaturate


These functions adjust the Saturation of the colors HSL values, much like Darken and Lighten adjusted the Lightness. You need to give a percentage value to saturate and desaturate. 

    saturate($TigersEye, 20%)
    desaturate($Amber, 20%)

####Adjust-hue

This adjusts the hue value of HSL the same way all of the others do. Again, it takes a percentage value for the change.

    adjust-hue($OliveDrab, 20%)

####Adding Alpha Transparency

Using our hex color we can do a few things to get it to be a little transparent. We can call hsla, rgba, opacify, and transparentize. All of them accomplish the same thing, just in different ways. I stick to rgba as it comes most naturally to me which takes a color and a value from 0 to 1 for the alpha.

    rgba($AppleGreen, .7)
